From Jay: November 22, 2015

Tamara and I met the Sunday before thanksgiving. 2:50pm to 5:30pm. We
hadn't met in a while, so we went through the assignments she had
completed since we last met. Her current assignment was restoring
multiple JPEG files from a single file that represented deleted blocks.
Some of this assignment required using pointers and we talked a bit to
make sure the concept was solid for her.

By the end of our time, she had completed the assignment and very
excited by seeing all these files that came from nowhere. Also she was
excited that it worked on the first try after fixing compilation issues!
She had been thinking about the problem already, and had a pretty good
diagram that made it easy to map out all the cases. It was a very
practical assignment, cloning raw blocks to a file on another drive is a
pretty reasonable file recovery procedure.
