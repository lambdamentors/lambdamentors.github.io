From Jay: July 27, 2015

Last week Tamara and I met at the Coder Girl meeting from 6:10-9pm. We continued with the Cohort project Asteroids in Ruby. Our focus was integrating a physics engine, Chipmunk, into the existing code base by swapping out a bit of the basic geometry that was previously done by hand. By the end, she had a ship flying around with thrust. It was pretty cool. We do not have another meeting on the books yet.
