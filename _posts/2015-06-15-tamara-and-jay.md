From Jay: June 15, 2015

Tamara and I met at a wifi cafe from 6pm-9pm last week Tuesday June 9th. That meeting had breaks, so a safe estimate of 2.5 hours of mentoring.

We started out with her current MP in CS50, which has a very simple instruction: implement Breakout. But that instruction has a lot of leeway in what the final product could be.  We basically went over what she had implemented already, and I talked her through refactorings as related to how she wanted to customize her version of the Breakout game. I encouraged her to use the C std library functions more, since she was refraining. She worried that they made the implementation too simple. We also went through using the gdb, since this was her first gui assignment and printf's did not work.

The rest of our time was spent going over her CoderGirl group project in Ruby. She had been assigned some tasks in Github, but didnâ€™t have any experience with Github, Git, or Ruby yet. We went over Git and Github, and finished getting her environment setup for working on the project. She has already started Codecademy Ruby tutorials, but she needs to spend more time on the tutorials before starting the tasks assigned to her. We are scheduled to meet again Tuesday, June 16th.
