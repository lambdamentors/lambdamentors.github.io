From Jay: August 6, 2015

We met 7/30 from 6:10pm-9:20pm. We continued focusing on the group project.  Tamara worked on using the collision handling functions in the physics engine to determine if the ship is touching the edge of the screen and then draw its overlap on the opposite side. This was a task I came up with the week prior as a way to learn how the collision handling works and also build on what we've already done.

After it was done, it became obvious that the original geometry code had some edge cases the kept it from looking smooth, so the result was pretty cool.

Afterwards, I wrote some new issues for things she could use to learn or improve upon based on some visual artifacts that she noticed.
