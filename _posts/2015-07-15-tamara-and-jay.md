From Jay: July 15, 2015

Met with Tamara last week 7/9 from 6:20pm to 9:25pm.  Our main focus was her group Cohort project in Ruby.  Although she's been doing the Codecademy Ruby tutorials, it hasn't yet gotten to Object Oriented Programming, but she's certainly become more fluent in Ruby. Her next task in the Cohort project was related to the player ship from their Asteroids game. We focused on event handling and worked on making the ship rotate using the arrow keys. This gave her the basic framework for how to handle key presses before doing more complicated things like thrust and firing. We are not meeting this week, but I also emailed her some follow up information that I found on handling physics using their Ruby game library. That is her next assigned task.
