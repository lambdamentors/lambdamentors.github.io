From Jay: August 24, 2015

We still continued on the Coder Girl Cohort Project. It's almost done.

Met with Tamara from 7-9pm August 12 at Coder Girl.

Helped guide her through the following issues

[CS50-Cohort-Project-Redux/issues/12](https://github.com/dummey/CS50-Cohort-Project-Redux/issues/12)

[CS50-Cohort-Project-Redux/issues/11](https://github.com/dummey/CS50-Cohort-Project-Redux/issues/11)

[CS50-Cohort-Project-Redux/issues/10](https://github.com/dummey/CS50-Cohort-Project-Redux/issues/10)

That went relatively quickly and then she finally added UFO collisions.

Met with Tamara from  6-9:20pm August 19th at Coder Girl.

We mainly worked on lasers in the game. She had a pretty good start because she started working on it from what I originally spec'd out:

[CS50-Cohort-Project-Redux/issues/17](https://github.com/dummey/CS50-Cohort-Project-Redux/issues/17)

Also, a couple days before our meeting, she emailed to ask about Git branching, because she wanted to continue working from a different part of the history, before some other group member changes, to make it easier to test the lasers. When we met, I encouraged her to refactor a bit of the code she wrote for the player so that she could reuse much of what she built for the ship.

Although lasers weren't completely finished, we stopped at a good point. Now she's reached a fun part of the project because all the infrastructure is there and there's a lot to just play with to get it to look just right.
