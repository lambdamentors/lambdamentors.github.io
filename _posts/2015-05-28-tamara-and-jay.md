From Jay: May 28, 2015

The charity Iâ€™ve chosen is [Safe Connections](https://safeconnections.org) they are local and also a United Way partner.

May 20th at CoderGirl, after the Alison Hawke presentation, Tamara and I were introduced. We spent an hour and fifty minutes talking about programming as a career and discussing/looking at a previous and current machine problem she had for cs50x.

Tamara and I corresponded through email this week and did not meet, but we did figure out places with wifi that were convenient for both of us to meet if not on a codergirl night.  We are planning on trying to meet next week, but my schedule is a bit variable next week specifically, so we don't have anything on the books yet.
