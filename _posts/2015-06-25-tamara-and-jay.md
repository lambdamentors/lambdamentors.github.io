From Jay: June 25, 2015

Met with Tamara and also expected to meet with her Cohort project group at the weekly CoderGirl. However, she was the only one to show up. Her Cohort group project, due to people dropping, has switched to implementing the game Asteroids in Ruby with the Gosu game library. She implemented a moving star background for the game. This meeting lasted 6pm-8:20pm.
