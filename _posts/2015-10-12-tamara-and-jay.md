From Jay: October 12, 2015

Our last meeting was Tuesday September 29th, 6:40 - 9:10pm.  It was our first session since her Ruby project was finished and she needed to get back into the swing of things in C. We went over all her original first 2 weeks of machine problems from the CS50x class. Now having a fresh look at them, with everything she learned from the Ruby project, I had her refactor them. It went really well. Our next meeting was supposed to be last week Tuesday, but she had the flu. We’ve rescheduled to meet tomorrow.
