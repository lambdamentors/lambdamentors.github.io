From Jay: June 17, 2015

Tamara and I met up again at wifi cafe from 6:20pm to 9:15pm, Tuesday 6/16, with breaks, so I'd estimate 2.5 hours again. We mainly focused on her group project. She still has more to do in her Ruby tutorial, so we chose a simple task assigned to her and worked through it. This gave her the general idea of how to work on a task in Github. We started with versioning in Git, creating specs with Rspec, running the tests, implementing features piecemeal, and referencing issues with the commits.  A lot of time was spent getting Windows to work well with a decent workflow for Ruby, but we got it by the end. We are going to try and schedule meeting up again next week, but we don't have anything on the books yet.
