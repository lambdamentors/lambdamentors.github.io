From Jay: September 2, 2015

Tamara and I met Monday, August 24th. We went through almost everything left on her portion of the Asteroids project that was needed to make it a playable game. She mainly worked on making the laser until she was happy with the visuals and behavior of them. She also refactored the shared drawing code to take an optional transparency parameter, so she could draw a motion blur for the laser spinning.  When her group met later that week, she was able to help other people with their tasks, mainly the asteroids weren't using the physics and collision detection yet.  The game is pretty playable now and ready for a demo at Lambda Lounge.
