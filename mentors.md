Lambda Mentors are experienced software developers and (generally) regular participants
in the Lambda Lounge [http://lambdalounge.org] user group. They have contacts at several
organizations through their well-established professional and social networks. Mentors
are passionate about the field of software development, pursue technologies they love,
and want to give back to a community they have benefitted from participating in.

The Lambda Mentors program pairs each mentor with a learner. Mentors then provide learners
with a variety of professional guidance, which can range from pairing on a software project,
to providing book recommendations, to suggesting worthwhile conferences, to other activities
that enrich learners’ expanding understanding of computer science.

In return for sharing their valuable time and experience, Lambda Mentors facilitates donations
to a charity of the mentor’s choice. Lambda Mentors seeks out [sponsor
organization](/sponsors.html)
who agree to donate $50 to the charity of the mentor’s choice for
each hour of mentoring. In this way, mentors, while not compensated directly, can give back,
both through charitable contributions and through guiding the development of the learners
with whom they work.
